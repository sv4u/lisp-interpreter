# Simple (Custom) Lisp Interpreter Language Specifications

Currently, this language is extremely basic. The main goal of this language is to be simple and pure. Here is a table of what has been and has not been implemented:
| Language Spec. | Date implemented |
| --- | --- |
| Standard math | 01 - 13 - 2017 |
| Data types | 01 - 13 - 2017 |
| Advanced math |	*currently in the works* |
| For & While loops | *currently in the works* |
| Proper exit from repl() | *currently in the works* |

More information will come when I have a bit more time to clearly layout a plan for this language!

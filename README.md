# A Simple (Custom) Lisp Interpreter

**SCLI** (*A Simple (Custom) Lisp Interpreter*) is a custom Lisp interpreter built in Python 3.6.0. It is meant to follow the language I developed that is an offshoot of Lisp.

## Motivation

I have been interested in creating a programming language for the past year. So, I decided to read a bunch of manuals and then one day I finally tried writing one. This is the outcome of that day.

## Usage

In the Python console, import the [interpreter](https://github.com/sv4u/lisp-interpreter/blob/master/SCLI.py)
```python
>>> from SCLI import *
```
Once the interpreter has been imported, run the '<repl()>' function like so:
```python
repl()
```

## TODO
- [x] Implement Lisp in Python
- [ ] Create a more user friendly interface for programming
- [ ] Fully finish language customization
- [ ] Add cryptographic functions
